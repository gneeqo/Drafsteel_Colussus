[Intro]
I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
But I really hope and pray
Can we get it together?
Get it together
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep  
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath  
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

[Verse 1: Roddy Ricch]
All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe
Either you from the Yah Gang or you're SuWoop
Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
And I'm that nigga now, who knew?
[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
I been wakin' up to get the money, woah, woah
Got a bad bitch, her ass tatted, woah, woah
Givenchy to my toes, two twins, I'm fucking 'em both
I put her in a new AP, the water like a boat
I was down bad on my dick, where was you niggas at?
I know you turned your back on me just to get some racks
I seen you swerve back, 'cause I'm in the black 'Bach
New diamonds on me, fuck a flash, this ain't Snapchat
'Cause I been gettin' paid
Yellow diamonds on me look like lemonade
Got my baby mama that new Bentayga
Tryna get the dough, Joe, like a sensei, yeah
Rolls Royce umbrellas when I'm in the rain
I just mind my business
I got brothers that did the time, I ain't kiddin'
All these rappers just talk about it, I live it
Goin' up, I ain't got no sky limit, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

[Outro: Roddy Ricch]
I, ayy, yeah
I've been ballin', lil' nigga
Now watch me ball on these niggas
Yeah, now watch me ball on these niggas, yeah
Now watch me ball on these niggas
Now watch me ball on these niggas, yeah, yeah

Draft 1 (ROUGH)
Stanza 1:
I put the new cards inside the sleeves
I mulligan I, gotta put a card underneath
Got yorion, just let me pay the three
Keep 80 cards inside my library
I was winning but he flashed in containment priest
Now I really can’t win the game so I’m stalling
Be keeping us here playing stax till the morning
CounterSpell a win con this player's salty

Stanza 2:
All this removal in his hand got me drip drip
Got a magic sword I’m gonna equip
If there’s nothing in my hand gotta flick flick
If I cast at least one spell, then his werewolves won’t flip

Stanza 3:
I already went 0-2 this is gonna be a set back
How many lands has he got I can’t even keep track
Always gonna keep a mana open to make a spell quack
If I make this go to turns I could still get a free pack
Cause if you take too long, don’t play your turns fast
The event still has to go, can’t hold everyone back
And I got some lifegain, yeah I got a big stack
It’s not exactly sportsmanlike, but I don’t give a crap
The game is clearly over but I won’t scoop
He’s starting to realize how low I will stoop
Gonna pause on every spell, that’s why I’m playing blue
No response but I can still tap twoooo

Stanza 4:
I put the new cards inside the sleeves
I mulligan I , gotta put a card underneath
Got yorion, just let me pay the three
Keep 80 cards inside my library
I was winning but he flashed in containment priest
Now I really can’t win the game so I’m stalling
Be keeping us here playing stax till the morning
CounterSpell a win con this player's salty

Stanza 5:
Didn’t think that I’d ever go so low
If this draws I could still get a promo
If he gets a bolt I’m toast but just a shock it’s close
I got the board on lockdown I just hope I don’t choke
IPG 4.7 what the hell is that?
I know you made that up just to get some packs
So cast your flashbacks and cast your fayden dacks
Fuck all your stupid topdecks you’re a luck sack
But now it’s getting late
He’s getting frustrated he aint thinking straight
Bluffin counterspell I just got one taii (ga)
Now it’s lethal but I got unlikely aid
I’m taking long as I can to play
We only got 2 minutes
But the judge sees and knows I can’t win this
Slow play ain’t just wrong it’s reckless
Got kicked out and now I’m banned from this LGS yeaaahhh

Stanza 6:
I put the new cards inside the sleeves
I mulligan I , gotta put a card underneath
Got yorion, just let me pay the three
Keep 80 cards inside my library
I was winning but he flashed in containment priest
Now I really can’t win the game so I’m stalling
Be keeping us here playing stax till the morning
